description: |
  Python's pickle module is a popular serialization/deserialization tool that converts Python objects into byte streams and vice versa. However, when untrusted data is deserialized using pickle, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
  This vulnerability occurs when an application deserializes user-controlled data using the pickle module without proper validation. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary commands on the target system.
